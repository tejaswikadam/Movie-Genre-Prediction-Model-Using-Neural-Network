# Movie-Genre-Prediction-Model-Using-Neural-Network
Movies, TV shows and Web Series are the greatest forms of entertainment in today’s era but not everyone has the same taste in terms of genres which they like. Ten years ago, it was very difficult to classify the movie genre but with the help of advanced techniques of ‘Deep Learning’ now it seems very easy. The idea of this project was to classify the user input into one or more movie genres and then suggest few movies based on those genres. This project explores the possibility of using Deep Neural Networks, NLP and HAN to classify the keywords as per genre using the movie summary plots and then provide the user with movie names which belong to that genre. Two models were compared in order to testify the working of this project. This module will be useful in saving users time and effort while searching for a specific movie and Deep Learning makes this process convenient and hassle free.
